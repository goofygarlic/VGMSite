      <h1>Building a Setting</h1>
      <p>
        To illustrate how music can build upon a setting, I will be drawing from multiple games from the Persona franchise. Specifically, I will be using moments from Persona 3 Reload and Persona 4 Golden. A key component in all 3 of these games is the interactions between characters of the main cast. These are seen through social links, a feature of the game where you can hang out with a character for the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        One such example of a soundtrack that could play during a social link in Persona 4 is the track SMILE. In the social link for the character Rise Kujikawa, her rank 9 link uses this soundtrack in the background while she is talking to the player about her struggles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout not just her social link, but the main story as well, Rise’s development comes from finding her true self. At the start of the game, she is seen as someone with multiple personalities, none of whom truly encompass who she is. Progressing through her social link, she comes to learn that all these parts do in fact represent herself. The soundtrack SMILE enhances this moment using instruments such as the piano and synth. The overall happy tone of the song adds onto the moment as Rise has finally found a sense of her true self, giving her closure to one of her biggest insecurities. This soundtrack gives this moment a sense of closure and reflection to one of the most important characters in this game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example can be seen in Persona 3 Reload, with the soundtrack Living With Determination – Iwatodai Dorm Arrangement. This soundtrack plays during the month of January, where at this point, the player is attempting to fight against the impending doom of the world, all culminating to the final day (January 31st). Iwatodai Dorm is where the main cast stays for the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        The soundtrack samples Living With Determination, a soundtrack used in different moments earlier in the game to reflect a feeling of sorrow and sadness. The primary difference between the original and the Iwatodai Dorm arrangement is the use of drums and a lack of a violin, whereas the original does not contain any drums and uses a violin. This arrangement gives a sense of determination to the player, with the drums providing the feel to continue onward, even though the impending doom of the end of the world is coming soon. It still gives the same feeling of sorrow and dread the original does, with the added effect of trying to will yourself against it, which is the end goal of the entire game—to change your fate with your own power. The soundtrack delivers on this message in a beautiful way.
